This is still a rough draft!
<!--
Write script to convert semantic vars for math vars by rewriting to called_111_coef_beta -> beta

Infer data types for Stan variables

Can add functions to run.R to support data in this workflow checklist, e.g., check_rhat() and add to the executable.

Figure out a way to keep all history with a local db, snapshot of disk included.
